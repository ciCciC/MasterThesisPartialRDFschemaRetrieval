### Abstract
There are various data structures that represent data interrelationships in the universe of information. One is a graph-based data structure, which depicts a collection of entities connected by relationships. Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a widely used data model that facilitates the storage of graph-based data. This system, unlike standardised SQL, lacks a consistent schema that evolves over time. When presenting a complete schema is crucial, the loose standards combined with timeout limits in the retrieval process pose a challenge. The objective of this master's thesis is therefore to develop a partial schema retrieval pipeline in order to solve the previously outlined problem. We evaluate the quality of our approach by measuring performance and completeness. This is conducted by running the pipeline against several SPARQL-endpoints. The pipeline lays the foundation for retrieving partial graph schemas per iteration. The result is a rendered set of visualisations of partial schemas displayed in a hierarchical aggregated view. This should provide the ability to iteratively express portion of a graph, regardless of the evolving schema.
